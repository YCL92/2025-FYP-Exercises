[p-hacking demo](https://github.com/YCL92/2025-FYP-Exercises/blob/main/08_classifiers_and_evaluation/optional_p-hacking_with_sols.ipynb)

## Week 9: Report writing

Exercises: [Coursera Writing Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sciwrite#modules)

Very useful: Modules 1, 2

Also useful: Modules 3, 4, 5

Other tips: 

- Can you add 'by zombies' after the verb in the sentence? If so, it's likely in the passive voice and can be re-written.
- Read the first sentence in each paragraph, does it still make sense

## Week 10: Logistic Regression

Exercises: [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/YCL92/2025-FYP-Exercises/blob/main/10_logistic_regression/Exercise-week_13.ipynb)

## Week 11: Group work and Exam Demo

TA's will demonstrate the exam procedure. This will be a presentation, followed by an oral exam.

Afterwards, you can ask questions, and continue to work on your own exam projects.
