    "This exercise is meant to demonstrate p-hacking, the misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant. P-hacking is poor scientific practice, because it ignores the multiple-comparisons problem: the more statistical tests are performed on the data and the more inferences are made, the more likely erroneous inferences (like false positives or Type I errors) become.\n",
